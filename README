The Rutgers IEEE Robotics club is proud to announce a brand new line following robot kit for the 2010-2011 school year.  This kit is easier to both assemble and program.  It features an Arduino Decimilia brain board, a Line following Robot Shield, a Line sensor board, and Solarbotics GM9 motors and wheels.   It includes everything you need to get your robot up and running.  All you need to do is supply the chassis and write your own line following program. 

This kit is the cheapest and most customizable robotics kit possible. To assemble the kit, all you need to do is solder through-hole components.   It is suitable for beginners who have never soldered before and for masters who want a quick platform with which to build their robot. We will be holding Workshop sessions each week at the start of the semester to teach people how to assemble and program their kit.

The Line following shield sits on top of the Arduino board and provides a clean interface to the Arduino microcontroller for your motors and line sensor. The line following shield includes a motor driver to control your GM8 motors.  The line following board uses a IR Emitter and Phototransistor pair to accurately and easily locate the line.
